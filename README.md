# Encrypted

The goal of Encrypted is to make it easier to get in touch with large groups of people and eliminate the need to message each member of the group individually. Although itâ€™s a public message board, each message is password-protected and lets only the intended recipients read the message. Using Encrypted to coordinate huge gatherings is way more convenient than contacting every person individually, or even creating a big Facebook group. Give it a shot!
